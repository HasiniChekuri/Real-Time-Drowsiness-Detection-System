# Drowsiness & Yawning Detection System ðŸ’¤

A **real-time drowsiness and yawning detection system** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, **dlib**, and **Tkinter**. This project monitors a personâ€™s eye and mouth movements through the webcam and alerts the user when drowsiness or yawning is detected.

---

## Project Overview

This project detects:

- **Sleeping:** Eyes fully closed for a prolonged period.  
- **Drowsiness:** Eyes partially closed or blinking slowly.  
- **Yawning:** Mouth open beyond a threshold.  

It provides **real-time visual feedback** and **audio alerts**.

## Features

- Real-time face and landmark detection using `dlib`.  
- Eye aspect ratio (EAR) based blink and drowsiness detection.  
- Mouth aspect ratio (MAR) based yawning detection.  
- Visual feedback: Status messages displayed on video (`Active :)`, `Drowsy !`, `SLEEPING !!!`, `Yawning !!!`).  
- Audio alert: Beep sound triggers when prolonged eye closure is detected.  
- Tkinter GUI: Simple interface with a start button and background image.
